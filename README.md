# Substantial / Social Chorus iOS code test

Yet another table -> detail view code test, where we're listing the top 5 records of all time, along with their artists. 

The twist this time is that we get to use a [JSON API library](https://github.com/joshdholtz/jsonapi-ios) I had never heard of before, as well as my first exposure to a web service thing called Apiary.

The spec is found at on [Apiary](http://docs.recordsapi.apiary.io/) while a napkin sketch for the UI is found on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sc/58pbknspe0cz1v8/AAAk0kX_9X12JtsZpoQp0zNna)

### Updates

**1.0** | Initial release. This is where I finished at the end of about an hour on the phone with the Substantial guy.  By that point I already had a good introduction to working with the open source library and with what one can do with Apiary.
